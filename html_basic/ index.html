    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Abdelmounaim, and this is my first HTML page as part of my ALX journey.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about technology and always eager to learn something new every day.</p>

    <h3>What I’m Learning</h3>
    <p>Currently, I’m learning HTML, CSS, and Git to build solid foundations in web development.</p>

    <p>In the near future, I plan to build bigger projects and explore the world of full-stack development.</p>
